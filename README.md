## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a crucial aspect of natural language processing (NLP). Traditional models often struggle with negations, which can drastically alter the meaning of a phrase. For example, "not good" should convey a negative sentiment, but many models misinterpret it. Our enhanced model intelligently tags words following negators, preserving the sentiment context and improving accuracy.

## Features

- **Custom Negation Handling**: Smart tagging of words after negators, ensuring that sentiment is preserved.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Models show enhanced performance in real-world scenarios compared to generic approaches.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to integrate and use for various applications.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear instructions and examples for quick setup and usage.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Enhanced Sentiment Analysis model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omurkoc/enhanced-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd enhanced-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Model**:
   You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/omurkoc/enhanced-sentiment-analysis/releases). Download the model file and execute it according to the instructions provided.

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can start using the model for sentiment analysis. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```python
from sentiment_analysis import SentimentAnalyzer

analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze("I am not happy with the service.")
print(result)  # Expected output: Negative sentiment
```

### Input Format

The model accepts text inputs, and it works best with sentences or short paragraphs. Ensure that the text is clean and free from excessive punctuation.

### Output

The output will be a sentiment classification, typically as "Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral". The model also provides a confidence score for the classification.

## Model Comparison

We conducted a thorough comparison between our enhanced model and traditional models that do not handle negations. The results were significant:

- **Enhanced Model**: Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the IMDB dataset.
- **Traditional Model**: Achieved only 75% accuracy.

These results demonstrate the importance of negation handling in sentiment analysis. By tagging words following negators, our model captures the true sentiment of the text.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the model.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: Used for text processing and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
