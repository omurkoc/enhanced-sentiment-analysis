# enhanced-sentiment-analysis
A unique sentiment analysis model on IMDB reviews with custom negation handling. Instead of generic preprocessing, it smartly tags words after negators like "not" (e.g., "not good" â†’ "not_good"), preserving sentiment context. Comparison of models with and without this logic shows improved accuracy and real-world reliability.
